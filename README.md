# matplotlib-kthcolors
Collection of KTH colors for matplotlib

## Installation
Installation steps may vary depending on your OS.
In general, I would expect the following bash command to work just fine.
```
python setup.py install
```

## Usage
1. Import the module as follows.
```
import kthcolors
```
2. Use `matplotlib` as usual. Here is an example.

plt.figure()
plt.plot([1,2],[2,3],color='kthblue')
plt.show()
```
